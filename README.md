## Applying ML techniques on highly dimensional mass spectroscopy data to enable early detection of pancreatic cancer.


Pancreatic cancer is a deadly cancer, and is typically diagnosed in its late stages. The average 5-year survival is around 9%, but over half of the patients are diagnosed after the cancer metastasises to other organs of the body, at which point, the survival rate drops to around 3% ([Source](https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/pancreas.html)). Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most common form of pancreatic cancer is notoriously resistant to established treatments such as chemotherapy owing to certain characteristics of the tumor microenvironment. Having previously worked in this space, I have been fascinated by the unique characteristics of the disease. One thing is clear: **Early detection is key to improving the survival outcomes of the disease.** 

The healthcare industry is starting to leverage data to develop new insights in medicine. I began researching ways to apply machine learning techniques to contribute to cancer research. This led me to an excellent [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-data-science-enables-early-cancer-diagnosis-6221ae841ae3) by Peter Liu, where he applied machine learning techniques to a high dimensional mass spectroscopy data on ovarian and prostate cancer. In this article, I attempt to replicate his work on a dataset on pancreatic cancer, and combine his work with my own intuition and experience in pancreatic cancer research. 

The mass spectroscopy data is publicly available [here](https://home.ccr.cancer.gov/ncifdaproteomics/ppatterns.asp). Refer to the diagnosing-pancreatic-cancer.ipynb file in this repository to take a look at the code and visualizations.
